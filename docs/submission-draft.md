# D479 Task 1 — UX Design Artifacts for Taniti Tourism Website

This draft maps to rubric parts A–H. Paste into a Word document (.docx) and format headings. Insert screenshots from `wireframe/` and the live prototype URL where noted.

## A. Project Timeline
See `docs/timeline.md` (4‑week plan within the scenario month).

## B. Persona Profile
See `docs/persona.md` (based on Survey Results + About the Island).

## C. Low‑Fidelity Wireframe
- Open `wireframe/index.html` and capture mobile + desktop screenshots.
- Include `assets/sitemap.svg` to demonstrate information architecture and flow.
- Wireframe aligns to persona by prioritizing: Explore, Plan Trip CTA, Getting Around, FAQs.

## D. Guerrilla Usability Testing
1) Summary of qualitative feedback (actionable vs. not)
- Promote “Plan Your Trip” CTA (Actionable)
- Surface bus hours and options on Home and Transport (Actionable)
- Add FAQs for alcohol hours and drinking age (Actionable)
- Add “Top 5 Things To Do” (Actionable)
- Polish branding/visual style (Partially actionable in prototype; full visual polish out of scope)
- Direct on‑site booking (Not actionable in scope; link to providers instead)

2) Implementation plan
- CTA elevated in header and hero; improved visual prominence
- Transport quick facts on Home; detailed section in Getting Around
- FAQs added under Plan → common questions (alcohol hours, drinking age, power, holidays, English, currency)
- Curated Top 5 added on Home and Explore
- Accessibility improvements: contrast and spacing adjustments

See `docs/usability-testing.md` for full notes and plan.

## E. Interactive Prototype (URL)
- File: `prototype/index.html` (mobile‑first single‑page prototype with hash‑based navigation and filterable Explore cards)
- Hosting steps in `README.md`. Publish and paste URL here:

Prototype URL: ________________________________
Prototype URL: https://<username>.github.io/taniti-ux-prototype/prototype/index.html


How it reflects feedback:
- CTA “Plan Trip” is now primary and above the fold.
- Ground transport hours are shown on Home and Transport.
- FAQs include alcohol hours and drinking age.
- Top 5 attractions visible near the top.

## F. Five Objective Usability Tasks
