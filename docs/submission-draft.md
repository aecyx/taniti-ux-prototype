# D479 Task 1 — UX Design Artifacts for Taniti Tourism Website

## A. Project Timeline
Four‑week plan within the scenario month:
- Week 1: Discover/Define (review survey and island docs, persona, IA/sitemap, low‑fi wireframes).
- Week 2: Design/Validate (expand flows, prepare guerrilla test plan, test with 3+ users, synthesize feedback).
- Week 3: Prototype/Iterate (mobile‑first interactive prototype reflecting wireframe, apply prioritized feedback, accessibility).
- Week 4: Validation/Handoff (five objective tasks, APA sources, submission draft, final review).

## B. Persona Profile
Primary persona (planner traveler): Age 32; USA; party size 2–4; stay 3–7 days; mobile‑first. Goals: discover attractions (beaches, rainforest, volcano, zip‑line), understand transport hours/options, find lodging and booking links, confirm practical info (currency, power, alcohol hours, drinking age, holidays, safety). Behaviors: skims; wants clear nav and prominent CTAs; prefers trustworthy info and provider links.

## C. Low‑Fidelity Wireframe
Mobile‑first layout with clear navigation (Explore, Stay, Dining, Getting Around, Plan Trip CTA), hero overview, attraction cards, Plan Your Trip section, and Practical Info/FAQ. The sitemap demonstrates flow from Home → Explore/Plan/Getting Around → child pages, aligned to persona priorities.

## D. Guerrilla Usability Testing
Summary (actionable vs. not):
- Promote “Plan Your Trip” CTA (Actionable)
- Surface bus hours and options on Home and Transport (Actionable)
- Add FAQs for alcohol hours and drinking age (Actionable)
- Add “Top 5 Things To Do” (Actionable)
- Visual style (contrast/spacing) (Partially actionable; branding out of scope)
- Direct on‑site booking (Not actionable; link to providers instead)

Implementation:
- Elevate CTA in header and hero; improve prominence
- Add transport quick facts on Home; full details in Getting Around
- Add FAQs (alcohol hours, drinking age, power, holidays, English, currency)
- Add curated Top 5 in Explore
- Improve contrast and spacing for accessibility

## E. Interactive Prototype (URL)
Mobile‑first single‑page prototype with clear navigation, quick facts, FAQs, and curated attractions.

Prototype URL: https://aecyx.github.io/taniti-ux-prototype/prototype/index.html


How it reflects feedback:
- CTA “Plan Trip” is now primary and above the fold.
- Ground transport hours are shown on Home and Transport.
- FAQs include alcohol hours and drinking age.
- Top 5 attractions visible near the top.

## F. Five Objective Usability Tasks
1. Find bus service hours for Taniti City.
2. Identify at least two adventure activities and how to book them.
3. Confirm alcohol sales hours and the drinking age on Taniti.

5. Verify currency and payment options accepted on the island.
