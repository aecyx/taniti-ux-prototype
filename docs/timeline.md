# Project Timeline — Taniti Tourism Website (4 Weeks)

Timebox: <= 1 month per scenario. Iterative sprints with weekly checkpoints and stakeholder reviews. Artifacts produced each week are exported and stored in `docs/` and the wireframe/prototype folders.

## Week 1 — Discover + Define
- Stakeholder kickoff; clarify success metrics (increase site visits, time on site, inquiry clicks) — Day 1
- Review “Survey Results” and “About the Island” (provided) — Day 1–2
- Synthesize insights and draft primary persona(s) — Day 2
- Draft IA: sitemap and content groups (Attractions, Stay, Dining, Getting Around, Plan Trip, FAQ) — Day 2–3
- Low‑fidelity wireframes (mobile‑first, then tablet/desktop) — Day 3–4
- Internal review and quick iteration — Day 5

Deliverables: Persona (docs/persona.md), Sitemap (assets/sitemap.svg), Low‑fi wireframe (wireframe/)

## Week 2 — Design + Validate (Round 1)
- Expand wireframes to cover key flows (browse attractions, plan trip, find transport, lodging) — Day 1–2
- Prepare guerrilla test plan + script and tasks — Day 2
- Recruit 3+ quick testers (peers/classmates) — Day 3–4
- Conduct guerrilla tests (15–20 min each) — Day 4
- Synthesize feedback and mark actionable vs. non‑actionable — Day 5

Deliverables: Guerrilla testing notes + summary (docs/usability-testing.md)

## Week 3 — Prototype (Interactive) + Iterate (Round 2)
- Build interactive, mobile‑first HTML prototype reflecting wireframe — Day 1–2
- Apply prioritized feedback (navigation clarity, CTA prominence, FAQs) — Day 2–3
- Light visual system for readability; accessible patterns — Day 3
- Internal spot checks + fixes — Day 4–5

Deliverables: Interactive prototype (prototype/index.html), hosting URL

## Week 4 — Validation + Handoff
- Define five objective usability tasks for Task 2 — Day 1
- Final pass for accessibility and content clarity — Day 1–2
- Package submission draft (A–H with APA) — Day 3–4
- Final review and submit — Day 5

Deliverables: `docs/usability-tasks.md`, `docs/submission-draft.md`, final prototype URL

## Assumptions & Risks
- Timebox respected; if testing slips, reduce scope, not quality.
- Mobile usage prioritized; desktop adapted responsibly.
- Hosting via GitHub Pages for URL submission.
