# Taniti Tourism UX Project

This workspace contains all artifacts for the Taniti tourism website redesign: timeline, persona, low‑fi wireframe, guerrilla testing plan/summary, interactive prototype, and submission draft.

Quick start
- Open `wireframe/index.html` for the low‑fidelity wireframe.
- Open `prototype/index.html` for the interactive prototype.
- All write‑ups are in `docs/` and are ready to paste into a Word document per the task requirements.

Publish the prototype as a URL (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public) named `taniti-prototype`.
2. Copy everything from this `prototype/` folder into the repo root.
3. Commit and push.
4. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
5. Wait ~1 minute; your prototype URL will be `https://<your-username>.github.io/taniti-prototype/`.
6. Paste that URL into your submission.

Alternative hosting options
- Netlify Drop (drag‑and‑drop the `prototype/` folder)
- GitHub Codespaces + Live Preview (URL acceptable if accessible by evaluators)

Submission tips
- Paste the content of `docs/submission-draft.md` into a Word file and format headings.
- Insert screenshots of the wireframe (from `wireframe/`) and the prototype.
- Keep the total submission under 200 MB and any single file under 16 MB.
