# Taniti Tourism UX Project

This workspace contains all artifacts for the Taniti tourism website redesign: timeline, persona, low‑fi wireframe, guerrilla testing plan/summary, interactive prototype, and submission draft.

Quick start
- Open `wireframe/index.html` for the low‑fidelity wireframe.
- Open `prototype/index.html` for the interactive prototype.
- All write‑ups are in `docs/`.

Publish the prototype as a URL (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public) named `taniti-ux-prototype` (or similar).
2. Place `prototype/` contents at the repository root, commit, and push.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
4. After build completes, your prototype URL will be `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/prototype/index.html`.
